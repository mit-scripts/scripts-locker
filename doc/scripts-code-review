Scripts has a policy of formal code review on Zephyr.  Commit messages
are zephyred to -c scripts -i r[number], with the actual diff sent to
-c scripts-auto -i commits.  Commits are also emailed to
scripts-commits@mit.edu.  All commits should be reviewed by another
scripts-team member before they are deployed.

The following designations are in use, with the following meanings:
"+1": I have reviewed and approve of this commit.

"+0": I've glanced at the commit and it seems okay.

"-0": I have mild issues with this commit, but am fine with it going
      in as-is and no further action being taken.

"-1": I do not approve of this commit, it needs more work. This
      designation must include an explanation of the objection, and
      will likely result in further action being taken either by the
      committer or the reviewer to improve the commit.

"-1, revert": I do not approve of this commit, and believe it to be
      actively harmful to the project, such as introducing a security
      hole.  This designation must include an explanation of the
      objection.  The committer should revert the commit.

Reviewers should strive to give non-zero reviews whenever possible.
