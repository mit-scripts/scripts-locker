RT TRICKS

To edit stuff like ticket status, click "Basic" in the left.

Note the multiple ways to search for tickets: you can click "All
{new,open,waiting} Scripts Tickets" on the home page in the center, or
"Scripts" on the right in the list of queues.

You should take a look in "Preferences" at the left. Make sure "Notify
yourself of own updates" is on. You can also set the "Default Working Queue"
to Scripts, and give yourself a signature referring to scripts@mit.edu.

Another useful option here is to set an RT passwordfor your account, so you
don't need certs to log in (though it sometimes will keep asking you for
your password on each page load if you don't have certs) and so you can use
the zephyrbot).  The zephyrbot will take commands to
-c scripts -i [ticket number] of the form /set status=resolved or
/set owner=geofft.  You need to drop a file in
/mit/geofft/web_scripts/rt/rt-passwords by your username with the format:

"username" "yourawesomepassword"

And then ask geofft (zwrite geofft) to restart the RT bot.

Note that in the event that Geoff's account is compromised, it is possible
for an attacker to use this password do manipulate tickets in *any*
queue you have bits on, not just the Scripts one.

The RT bot will post ticket notifications as -c scripts -i nnn.  If you are
responding to a ticket, it is conventional to post "lock" to the appropriate
instance, so others know not to pre-empt you.  You should post "unlock" once
you are done handling the ticket.

You can also place these commands on a line by themselves inside e-mail; they
will be acted upon and removed before the e-mail gets sent back out.

If you're adding a *comment* (such as when you're forwarding a cname request
on to IS&T), don't use the 'To:' field, because it'll be clobbered by our
RT scrips and the mail won't actually go to the destination you added.
Instead, you should use the 'Cc:' field.  Similarly, if you're adding
*correspondence*, the 'Cc:' field will be clobbered and you need to use
the 'To:' field.

Don't CC other RT queues, it doesn't work. If you really need to, use your
e-mail client to forward it and remove the [help.mit.edu #nnn] tag.

E-mail to scripts-comment that carries a [help.mit.edu #nnn] tag will be
included in the ticket history for the scripts team to see, but will not be
sent to the user. You can use this for asking "Help, what do I do here?"
